			<h2>What technology is? </h2>
			<p class="paragraph">The importance and significance of technology in both our personal and professional
				life is
				expanding all the time. Understanding how people shape technology and how technology shapes people's
				interactions with one another and with the natural world is important not only for those who research,
				develop, and implement new technologies, but also for all the people and organizations who must use
				those
				technologies in their professional and personal lives.</p><br>
			<p class="paragraph">The term "technology" is not a neutral term. Depending on their point of view and the
				circumstances, various people have interpreted it differently. Technology is concerned with determining
				how
				knowledge might be creatively applied to organized tasks involving humans. Below, I have explained all
				different types of technology.</p><br>
			<h2>Different Types of Technology</h2><br>
			<ol class="techtypes">
				<li>Information Technology</li><br>
				<p class="paragraph">Everything that organizations do with computers is referred to as information
					technology
					(IT). Building communications networks for a company, safeguarding data and information, creating
					and
					administering databases, assisting employees with computer or mobile device problems, or performing
					a
					variety of other tasks to ensure the efficiency and security of business information systems are all
					examples of information technology. Demand for experts in this industry is high and expanding, and
					those
					joining the field have a variety of career routes to select from.</p><br>

				<li>Nuclear Technology</li><br>
				<p class="paragraph">Nuclear technology is the study of nuclear processes in atomic nuclei. Nuclear
					reactors,
					nuclear medicine, and nuclear weapons are examples of noteworthy nuclear technology. It is also used
					in
					smoke detectors and gun sights. Nuclear energy is the energy contained within an atom's nucleus, or
					core.
					The compact nucleus of an atom has a tremendous amount of energy. In reality, the force that holds
					the
					nucleus together is referred to as the "strong force." Nuclear energy may be utilized to generate
					electricity, but first it must be liberated from the atom. Atoms are divided to release energy
					during the
					nuclear fission process.</p><br>

				<li>Bio-Technology</li><br>
				<p class="paragraph">Biotechnology is a branch of technology that uses biological systems, live
					creatures, or
					components of them to develop or produce various goods. Brewing and baking bread are examples of
					biotechnology processes (the use of yeast ( live organism) to generate the desired output).
					Traditional
					biotechnology methods often use living creatures in their native state (or further improved via
					breeding),
					but more current biotechnology will generally include a more advanced alteration of the biological
					system or
					organism. Biotechnology now encompasses a wide range of fields (eg. genetics, biochemistry,
					molecular
					biology, etc.). Every year, new technologies and products are produced in fields such as medical
					(the
					creation of novel medications and therapies), agriculture (the development of genetically modified
					plants,
					biofuels, and biological therapy), and industrial biotechnology (production of chemicals, paper,
					textiles
					and food).</p><br>

				<li>Electronic Technology</li><br>
				<p class="paragraph">The use of scientific ideas and concepts in the design, manufacture, installation,
					testing,
					servicing, usage, and control of electrical and electronic parts, equipment, and systems is known as
					electronics technology. Electronics technology is employed in virtually every industry, including
					commercial, residential, and industrial. Electronic technology includes devices and equipment such
					as cell
					phones, computers, and tablets, circuit making and so on.</p><br>
				<div class="blog-img">

				<div class="desc">Fig: Electronic Technology</div>
				<li>Communication Technology</li><br>
				<p class="paragraph">Communication technology is the use of technology to send messages or information
					between
					people or machines. Information processing may assist humans in making decisions, solving problems,
					and
					controlling machines. The understanding, skills, and tools that served as the foundation for
					previous and
					present communication technology also serve as the foundation for new and improved technologies. All
					of the
					inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback related with sending and receiving messages or information
					are
					included in a communication system. The message to be send is input. The method by which the message
					is
					transported is referred to as the process. The message receipt at the other end is output. Feedback
					might be
					about static or clarity.</p><br>
				<div class="blog-img">

				</div>
				<div class="desc">Fig: Communication Technology</div>
				<li>Material Technology</li><br>
				<p class="paragraph">Materials technology is a broad topic that ranges from the manufacture of items
					from raw
					materials through the processing of materials into the shapes and forms required for specific
					purposes.
					Materials, such as metals, polymers, and ceramics, often have quite varied characteristics, which
					implies
					that the processes used to produce them are fundamentally different. Materials technology is a
					subject that
					is continually changing, and new materials with unique features lead to new applications. For
					example,
					combining different materials into composites results in completely new material characteristics.

				<li>Medical Technology</li><br>
				<p class="paragraph">Medical technology is described as the use of science to the development of
					solutions to
					health problems or challenges such as illness prevention or delay, or the promotion and monitoring
					of good
					health. Medical technology is a critical strategic aspect in the hospital's positioning and
					perception in
					the competitive environment of healthcare providers. A plethora of exciting new biomedical gadgets
					and
					systems are constantly being released. They are being implemented at a time when hospitals are under
					increasing pressure to save costs. Forecasting the deployment of medical technology and the ability
					to
					continually assess its impact on the hospital, as a result, need the hospital's willingness to make
					the
					commitment and give the support for such a program.</p><br>

				<li>Mechanical Technology</li><br>
			</ol>
			<p class="paragraph">Mechanical engineering technology is the application of engineering concepts and
				technical
				advances to the manufacture of usable machinery or products. Parts and assemblies are often analyzed
				using
				software tools such as Finite Element Analysis and/or Computational Fluid Dynamics. Using Computer Aided
				Design tools, 3D models may be created to depict components and assemblies. The models may also be
				utilized
				directly by software of computer-aided manufacturing to provide "instructions" for the fabrication of
				things
				represented by the models, using computer numerically controlled machining or other automated processes.
